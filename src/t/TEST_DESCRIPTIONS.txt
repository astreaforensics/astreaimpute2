Test1 - Simple math check
E and e are set to 0.01
P(D|H1,H1) = (1-E)^3 ; P(H1,H1) = 4/16
P(D|H1,H2) = (1/2)^3 ; P(H1,H2) = 8/16
P(D|H2,H2) = E^3
Therefore, BF = (1-E)^3 / (1/2)^3 = 7.762392
and Genotype LR = 7.762392 x (4/16)/(8/16) = 3.881196

Second haplotype has no data in the mpileup output, so
Genotype LR and BF should both be 1.0

Test2 - VCF output
No sites should pass the default BF and GLR ratios (20).
Therefore, VCF should have only the VCF header info.

Test3 - VCF output
Same as Test1 and Test2, but reducing BF and GLR cutoffs
to 3 using the -B and -G switches.
Output should be homozygous reference call.

Test4 - Further math check
mpileup data has two reads per site, all reference alleles
P(D|H1,H1) = (1-E)^2 x (1-E)^2 x (1-E)^2 = 0.941480149401
P(H1,H1) = 4/16
P(D|H1,H2) = (1/2)^2 x (1/2)^2 x (1/2)^2 = 0.015625
P(P1,H2) = 8/16
Therefore, BF = 0.941480149401/0.015625 = 60.2547295617
and Genotype LR = 60.2547295617 x (4/16)/(8/16) = 30.1273657808

Second haplotype has no data in mpileup, so GLR & BF = 1.0

Test5 - Math check, heterozygous call
mpileup data has one ref and one alt read per site
P(D|H1,H1) = ((1-E) x E)^3 = 9.70299e-07 - 0.000000970299
P(D|H1,H2) = (1/2)^2 x (1/2)^2 x (1/2)^2 = 0.015625
Same P(haplotypes) priors as above
Therefore, BF = 0.015625/9.70299e-07 = 16,103.283627
and Genotype LR = 16,103.283627 x (8/16)/(4/16) = 32,206.567254

Second haplotype has no data in mpileup, so GLR & BF = 1.0

Test6 - Math check, homozygous alternate call
mpileup data is the same as Test4, but instead of two reference
alleles, it has two alternate alleles at each site
BF and GLR ratios are the same as Test4, but with homozygous
alt allele calls

Second site, rsTEST2, no has mpileup data, just like Test1:
one reference allele per site. BF is identical to Test1: 7.762392
Haplotype frequencies are different now, though, with 1
haplotype of 000 and 2 haplotypes of 111.
So, GLR = 7.762392 x (1/4) = 1.940598

Test7 - Extraneous mpileup data
Same as Test6, but with non-reference and non-alternate allele
calls in the mpileup data
These should be ignored making identical output to Test6.

Test8 - Map quality and base quality cutoffs
Same as Test6, but with two extra reference allele calls.
But, one is below the map-quality cutoff (ASCII 5) and one
is below the base-quality cutoff (ASCII 5). Therefore, both should
be ignored, producing identical output to Test6
